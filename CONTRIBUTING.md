# How to contribute
<!--
I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

If you haven't already, come find us in IRC ([#opengovernment](irc://chat.freenode.net/opengovernment) on freenode). We want you working on things you're excited about.

Here are some important resources:

  * [OpenGovernment for Developers](http://opengovernment.org/pages/developer) tells you where we are,
  * [Our roadmap](http://opengovernment.org/pages/wish-list) is the 10k foot view of where we're going, and
  * [Pivotal Tracker](http://pivotaltracker.com/projects/64842) is our day-to-day project management space.
  * Mailing list: Join our [developer list](http://groups.google.com/group/opengovernment/)
  * Bugs? [Lighthouse](https://participatorypolitics.lighthouseapp.com/projects/47665-opengovernment/overview) is where to report them
  * IRC: chat.freenode.net channel [#opengovernment](irc://chat.freenode.net/opengovernment). We're usually there during business hours.

## Tests

<!-- TODO -->
## Always

1. Ready for production
2. [_conventional commits_](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
3. [commit atomico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_commit#:~:text=In%20the%20field%20of%20computer,is%20said%20to%20have%20succeeded). I.e:

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "<task>(<scope>): Brief description
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Code Convetion:
<!--TODO-->

<!--
Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * We indent using two spaces (soft tabs)
  * we follow [12 Factor App](https://12factor.net/)
  * We avoid logic in views, putting HTML generators into helpers
  * We ALWAYS put spaces after list items and method parameters (`[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`), around operators (`x += 1`, not `x+=1`), and around hash arrows.
  * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.
